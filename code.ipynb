We want to keep non-performance related features, as they are in the raw data: this includes the player name, his team, his position and the number of games played. Some metrics allow for just averaging over them (e.g. all averaged metrics). This is possible, as these metrics refer to an average game of a player in one split, i.e. playoff. Thus, taking their mean just means that the value now represents the average game of all tournaments, a player took part in. However, this can not be done for absolute measures who refer to a whole tournaments, such as kills. This is due to the fact that certain players have participated in different tournaments that had a different amount of games. This questions the general use of absolute measures."
