# LCKCL-2021-Talent-Identification
Descriptive project with the purpose of talent identification of players participating in LCK CL 2021, using publicly available data from https://oracleselixir.com/stats/players/byTournament. 
### Open the folder doc and click on the PDF to see the paper.
I developed performance metrics, vizualized them and ranked all players based on them. Check out the free paper to see what problems my metrics solve and what players I have identified. If you want to use my work, provide a reference to my page. The folder src contains a Jupyter notebook, in which I describe data aggregation and creation of the paper's plots. I also created plotly HTML plots and a small dash app of the same plots for more interactivity. I haven't updated variables names yet, thus they don't run now.
The notebook also contains a section about Bayesian inference on winrates of several teams. There, it can be shown that, assuming a Beta(2,2) prior, that the PDFs of team's posteriors are quite similar, providing evidence for the comparability of players, independently of their team.
